# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description
We had to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying the starter code given. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and will also display the current date on top of the scheduler.
